# 10k SNPs

This directory contains the process used to map 10k SNPs from Bachlava et al. (2012): https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0029814#s4 to new HA412v.2 genome

## Data

A 10k SNP Illumina Infinium SNP array was created by aligning short-read transcriptome data against a reference transcriptome made from assembled long-read ESTs from several elite sunflower lines. The top 10,640 SNPs were selected based on coverage, minimum allele frequency, mapping quality and annotations (putative introns or non-genic regions discarded).  
For details see Bachlava et al. (2012) https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0029814#s4  

This SNP array was used to genotype four mapping populations to construct a consensus linkage map: see Bowers et al. (2012) https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22870395/  

SNPs were also genotyped on a diverse collection of 271 sunflower lines (mostly overlapping with lines used to call SNPs in the current experiment). The total number of readily scorale, bi-allelic SNPs was 5,788, out of which 5,359 had MAF >/= 10%

## Data Exploration

Contextual sequences for the SNPs identified in Bachlava et al. (2012) were taken from supplementary file s006 and saved as a .txt file  
This file was converted to FASTA format using the following code:
```bash
awk
```
